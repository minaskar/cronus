**cronus** is a Python tool designed to facilitate *Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)* and *Nested Sampling (NS)*
in large supercomputing clusters. 

It relies on the powerful MCMC sampler **zeus** to do the heavy-lifting and incorporates various MPI features
along with a suite of automated *Convergence Diagnostics*. 

``cronus`` is designed to be used via the terminal using parameter files and it is particularly suited for
Astrophysical and Cosmological applications.
