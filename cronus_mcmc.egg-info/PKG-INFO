        **cronus** is a Python tool designed to facilitate *Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)* and *Nested Sampling (NS)*
        in large supercomputing clusters.
        
        It relies on the powerful MCMC sampler **zeus** to do the heavy-lifting and incorporates various MPI features
        along with a suite of automated *Convergence Diagnostics*. 
        
        ``cronus`` is designed to be used via the terminal using parameter files and it is particularly suited for
        Astrophysical and Cosmological applications.
