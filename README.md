![logo](logo.png)

**cronus** is a pure-Python tool designed to facilitate *Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)* and *Nested Sampling (NS)*
in large supercomputing clusters. It relies on the powerfull MCMC sampler **zeus** to do the heavy-lifting and
incorporates various MPI features along with a suite of automated *Convergence Diagnostics*. 

``cronus`` is designed to be used via the terminal using parameter files and it is particularly suited for
Astrophysical and Cosmological applications.
